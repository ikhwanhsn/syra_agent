# ✨ Tokenomics

The Syra token ($SYRA) powers the first x402-native AI Trading Intelligence Infrastructure. Our tokenomics align incentives between the platform, autonomous agents, and the community, emphasizing fair distribution, utility-driven value, and deflationary mechanics.

## Token Overview

| Parameter           | Details                   |

## Token Utility (x402-Optimized)

$SYRA is the native payment token for accessing trading intelligence APIs via x402 protocol.

### 1. **x402 API Access**

- Agents pay for API calls via x402 protocol (USDC/stablecoins)
- Seamless integration for autonomous agents
- Instant settlement on Solana (400ms)
- Sub-cent payments possible ($0.001+ per API call)

**Pricing Examples:**

- Sentiment API: $0.01 per call
- Risk Scoring: $0.10 per analysis
- Deep Research: $5.00 per request

### 2. **Staking for Discounts (soon)**

Lock $SYRA tokens to unlock tiered discounts on all x402 API calls:

| Staking Tier | Tokens Required | Discount | Additional Benefits |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| **Bronze**   | 10,000          | 10%      | soon                |
| **Silver**   | 50,000          | 25%      | soon                |
| **Gold**     | 100,000         | 40%      | soon                |
| **Platinum** | 500,000         | 50%      | soon                |

**Lock periods:** 30-day minimum. Longer locks = higher APY rewards.

### 3. **Governance Rights**

- Vote on new intelligence API features
- Approve data partnership investments (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal)
- Decide token burn rates and economic parameters
- Community-driven roadmap prioritization

**Voting Power:** 1 staked token = 1 vote

## Deflationary Mechanics

$SYRA has aggressive deflationary mechanisms to create scarcity as usage grows.

### Burn Mechanisms

| Source                        | Burn Rate                        | Frequency        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **USDC x402 Fee**             | 80% of x402 fee → buy & burn     | Each transaction |
| **USDC Revenue Buyback**      | 50% of x402 revenue → buy & burn | Monthly          |
| **Staking Rewards Unclaimed** | Unclaimed rewards burned         | Quarterly        |
| **Governance Proposals**      | 1,000 $SYRA proposal fee burned  | Per proposal     |

**Example Burn Calculation (Q4 2026):**

- Monthly x402 volume: $1,000,000 (all in USDC/stablecoins)
- 80% x402 volume buyback & burn: $800,000 worth of $SYRA purchased & burned
- 50% x402 revenue buyback & burn: $100,000 worth of $SYRA purchased & burned
- Governance fees: ~$10,000 worth of $SYRA burned
- **Total monthly burn: ~$910,000 worth of $SYRA**

At this rate, **30-50% of total supply could burn over 3 years.**

### Supply Dynamics

**Current Supply:** 1,000,000,000 tokens
**Target Supply (2027):** 500,000,000-700,000,000 tokens

As supply decreases and demand increases (more agents using APIs), price pressure increases.

## Revenue Model

Platform sustainability through multiple x402 revenue streams:

### Primary Revenue Sources

- x402 API call payments (pay-per-use intelligence)
- Enterprise white-label licensing ($10K-50K/month)
- Institutional custom model training ($50K-250K/year)
- Data licensing to quant funds and researchers

### Revenue Allocation

- **50%** → $SYRA buyback & burn
- **30%** → Operations & development
- **10%** → Staker revenue sharing
- **10%** → Ecosystem grants & partnerships

:::tip Target Metrics (End of 2026)

- **1,000+ agents** using APIs
- **$2M/month** x402 transaction volume
- **$1M/month** in $SYRA burns
- **80% gross margins** (API business)
  :::

## Long-Term Value Accrual

$SYRA captures value as the AI agent economy grows:

### Network Effects

1. **More agents** → More API calls → More burns → Lower supply
2. **Better data** → Better models → More agents (flywheel)
3. **Higher staking** → Less circulating supply → Price pressure

### Moat Building

- Proprietary training data from 1,000+ agents
- Cross-agent learning creates better intelligence over time
- First-mover advantage in x402 trading intelligence
- High switching costs once agents integrate our APIs

### Exit Scenarios (2027+)

- **Acquisition** by Coinbase, Bloomberg, or trading platform ($500M-2B)
- **Strategic merge** with major AI agent framework
- **Independent unicorn** with $50M+ annual revenue

In any scenario, $SYRA holders benefit from buybacks, revenue sharing, or acquisition premium.

## Comparison: Old vs New Model

| Aspect            | Old Model (B2C Trading Bot) | New Model (x402 Intelligence APIs)     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Users**         | Retail traders              | Autonomous AI agents                   |
| **Revenue**       | $10-50/month subscriptions  | $0.01-10 per API call via x402 (USDC)  |
| **Payments**      | $SYRA or fiat               | USDC/stablecoins via x402              |
| **CAC**           | $500-2,000 per user         | $0 (agents discover via x402scan)      |
| **Margins**       | 40-60%                      | 80-90%                                 |
| **Scalability**   | Linear (need support team)  | Exponential (APIs scale infinitely)    |
| **Token Utility** | Discounts & governance      | Staking discounts + burns from revenue |
| **Moat**          | Brand & features            | Proprietary data network               |
| **Exit Multiple** | 3-5x revenue                | 10-20x revenue                         |

**Bottom Line:** The new model is 10x more valuable with better economics and stronger moats.
