# Example OpenClaw agent config for using the SYRA x402 API
#
# 1. Enable the http_request tool so the agent can call external APIs.
# 2. Use tools.json in this folder to build full URLs (baseUrl + path + query).
# 3. Handle 402: when a request returns 402, parse the response body for payment
#    details, sign the payment (Solana/Base USDC), then retry the same request
#    with header X-Payment or PAYMENT-SIGNATURE set to the payment proof.
#
# For full x402 flow you may need a small wrapper or use an x402 client (e.g.
# @x402/fetch or openclaw-x402) that does 402 → pay → retry automatically.

agents:
  syra-api-agent:
    tools:
      - http_request
      # - web_search   # optional
      # - calculator   # optional
    # Optional: system prompt hint so the agent knows to use the SYRA API
    # system_prompt: |
    #   When the user asks for crypto news, signals, prices, or analytics,
    #   use the SYRA x402 API. Base URL: https://api.syraa.fun
    #   Endpoints are listed in openclaw/tools.json. If a request returns
    #   402 Payment Required, payment must be completed and the request
    #   retried with the X-Payment header.

# Example http_request usage (conceptual):
#
# 1. GET https://api.syraa.fun/news?ticker=BTC
#    → If 402: parse body, sign payment, then:
# 2. GET https://api.syraa.fun/news?ticker=BTC
#    Headers: { "X-Payment": "<signed_payment_proof>" }
#    → 200 + JSON response
