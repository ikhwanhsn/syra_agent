# api-playground

## Purpose of this folder

The **api-playground** folder is a **Syra API testing and exploration UI**. It lets developers:

- **Call Syra API endpoints** — build and send requests (e.g. signals, research, news, browse) from the browser.
- **Handle x402 payments** — connect a Solana wallet and complete pay-per-request flows where endpoints are gated.
- **Inspect responses** — view JSON and response details (e.g. via response viewer, history).

It uses the same **api** backend as the rest of the monorepo and is useful for integration work, debugging, and demos. Built with Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind.
