Are they promoting specific coins or projects? Which ones?
How has their sentiment shifted compared to 3-6 months ago?

3. THEMES & NARRATIVES

What emerging trends are they highlighting? (AI+crypto, regulations, ETFs, DeFi, etc.)
Are they discussing macroeconomic factors? (Fed policy, inflation, banking crisis)
What technical developments or upgrades are they focused on?
Any warnings or concerns they're raising?

4. INFLUENCE & IMPACT ANALYSIS

Synthesis Requirements:
COMPARE & CONTRAST:

Where do these influencers agree on market direction?
What are the major disagreements or debates between them?
Whose predictions have been most accurate recently?

IDENTIFY PATTERNS:

Common themes across multiple influencers = stronger signals

Changes in tone/sentiment = potential market turning points

MARKET IMPLICATIONS:

What actionable insights emerge from their collective commentary?
Which narratives are gaining momentum vs. fading?
Are there early warnings or opportunities being discussed?
What's the overall "temperature" of crypto sentiment from these leaders?


Deliverable Format:

Executive Summary (key findings in 5-7 bullet points)
Individual Profiles (2-3 paragraphs per influencer with recent highlights)
Consensus View (what most agree on)
Contrarian Takes (minority opinions worth noting)
Emerging Trends (new narratives gaining traction)
Red Flags & Warnings (risks being discussed)
Actionable Insights (what this means for crypto investors/traders)


Special Instructions:

Focus on tweets from the last 30 days, with context from the past 3-6 months
Include specific tweet examples with dates when citing claims
Note any shifts in their usual messaging patterns
Distinguish between data-driven analysis and promotional content
Highlight any coordination or echo chambers between influencers
