## What Is Syra?

**Syra** is an intelligent, research-driven **AI Trading Intelligence Agent** for the Solana ecosystem. It helps traders, analysts, and builders make smarter, data-based decisions by combining:

- **Real-time market data** — Live technical and contextual indicators
- **On-chain activity signals** — Holder flows, smart money, DEX activity
- **Narrative & sentiment intelligence** — News, trends, and market mood
- **Structured AI-driven research** — Clear, actionable insights with reasoning

Syra is used across **Telegram**, **API workflows**, and autonomous agents—including the **x402 Agent (Rank #1 on x402scan)**.

Syra is designed as **an intelligence layer**, not just a signal bot: it enhances understanding with structured research, risk-aware perspectives, and learning-oriented explanations.
